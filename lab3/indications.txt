implement algorithm scanning v2 from C2

for 1 symbol table instance use the algorithm from there
for 2 symbol table instances we have 1 symbolTable_identifiers and 1 symbolTable_constants and
the difference in the algorithm is the fact that we store identifiers separately from the
constants

I have to do: 1.a (1 instance)

Also, in the documentation add the class diagrams!
